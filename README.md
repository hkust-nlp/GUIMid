Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents' performance is often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich, reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then examine how incorporating these tasks in the mid-training phase facilitates generalization to GUI planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal reasoning, and textual reasoning. We find (1) Task generalization proves highly effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3\%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6\% improvement on WebArena and an 5.4\% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior assumptions, GUI perception data‚Äîpreviously considered closely aligned with GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training‚Äîhas a comparatively limited impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets, resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0\% on WebArena and 12.2\% on AndroidWorld.

We release our mid-training data for further research.

| **Non-GUI Agents** | **User**: "Given the items visible in the image, how can you plan to organize the cabinet to maximize its storage capacity and accessibility?"<br>**Assistant**: "To plan the organization of the cabinet, you should first assess the items currently stored there and their frequency of use. Items that are used more frequently, such as soap bottles and toilet paper, should be placed in easily accessible locations. Less frequently used items, such as the spray bottle and tissue box, can be stored in less accessible areas. Additionally, you can consider using storage solutions like baskets or dividers to separate items and make them easier to find. By organizing the cabinet in this way, you can maximize its storage capacity and ensure that items are easily accessible when needed" | ![](./assets/episode-127-step-36-image.png)  |
| **Multi-modal Math** | **User**: "This figure represents the graph of f(x) = 4*sin(c + pi*x/4), where c lies within the interval of (-pi, pi]. Local maximum values are achieved at f(8*k + 5)=4, where k is an integer. Taking the graph and above conditions into consideration, what does f(13/3) evaluate to?"<br>**Assistant**: "Considering that f(x) reaches its local maxima at f(8*k + 5)=4, where k is an integer, it follows that -4*sin(c + pi/4) = 4 and c + pi*(8*k + 5)/4 = 2*pi*m + pi/2, where k and m are integers, and this simplifies to c + 5*pi/4 = 2*pi*m + pi/2. As a result of solving, we have c=-3*pi/4. By plugging in the parameter values, the function becomes f(x) = -4*sin(pi*x/4 + pi/4). If we substitute x=13/3 into f(x), it results in f(13/3) = 2*sqrt(3). Thus, the value of f(13/3) is 2*sqrt(3)." | ![](./assets/func1.png)  |
